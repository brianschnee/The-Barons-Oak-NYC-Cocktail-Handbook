## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Using the Fetch API, I made a website that pulls drink data from https://www.thecocktaildb.com/. The user is then able to make a search based on a type of liquor or a cocktail name. The resulting list includes cocktails with ingredients and instructions on how to make the drink. 

## Future Optimizations:

<ul>
  <li>Add support for Mobile.</li>
  <li>Recommend searches based on the current input in the search bar.</li>
</ul>
